# [Computational Thinking](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%80%9D%E7%BB%B4)

Computational thinking builds on the power and limits of computing processes, whether they are executed by a human or by a machine.

Computational methods and models give us the courage to solve problems and design systems that no one of us would be capable of tackling alone. 

Computational thinking confronts the riddle of machine intelligence:
- What can humans do better than computers? and
- What can computers do better than humans? 

Most fundamentally it addresses the question: 
**What is computable?** Today, we know only parts of the answers to such questions. 

Computational thinking **involves** solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behavior, by drawing on the concepts fundamental to computer science.
Computational thinking includes a range of mental tools that reflect the breadth of the field of computer science. 

**Thinking like a computer scientist means more than being able to program a computer. It requires thinking at multiple levels of abstraction.**
